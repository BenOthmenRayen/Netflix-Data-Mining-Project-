# Netflix-Data-Mining-Project-
This project is a **data mining and analysis** task focused on understanding the behavior and preferences of Netflix users. By exploring and visualizing a dataset of Netflix user data, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and correlations between various features.  
## Projet Overview  
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix user dataset.
- Visualize key variables to better understand user behavior.
- Analyze correlations between user attributes.
- Extract insights that can help improve user experience and content recommendations.
## Techologie Used
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
## Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized Netflix user data such as:
- Viewing habits
- Subscription plans
- Account details
- Preferences and interactions
## Visualizations & Analysis  
The project includes:
- Histograms, boxplots, and pairplots for visual exploration.
- Heatmaps to show correlation matrices.
- Statistical tests and interpretation using Scipy.
